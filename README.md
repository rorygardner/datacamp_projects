# DataCamp Projects Repository

This repo serves as a portfolio of mini-projects from DataCamp. It includes projects from learning tracks on statistics, Python programming, SQL, and machine learning.

Each project is organized into its own folder, including code, data, and any relevant files.

## Repository Structure

- **airbnb_market_trends**\
    Exploring Airbnb market trends using CSV, TSV, and Excel data in Python. Includes data cleaning and analysis of categorical, datetime, and numeric data.

- **analyzing_motorcycle_sales**\
    Analysis of motorcycle part sales using SQL to extract and aggregate data.

- **analyzing_students_mental_health**\
    Analysis of student mental health data in SQL to draw insights about predictors of mental health issues.

- **clustering_penguins**\
    Simple K-Means clustering analysis of penguin species in Python using pandas and sklearn with matplotlib for visualization. Clusters penguin species after preprocessing and encoding categorical data, and summarizing cluster statistics.

- **customer_analytics_data_prep**\
    Data cleaning mini-project in python. Filtering and adjusting data types for an efficient storage solution.

- **exploring_nyc_test_results**\
    Identifying NYC schools with top math SAT scores, top 10 schools by total SAT score, and finding borough with top combined SAT scores, and summarizing key statistics for that borough.

- **hyp_testing_soccer**\
    This project investigates whether women's international soccer matches have more goals scored than men's by analyzing official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002. It tests the hypothesis statistically using match data stored in CSV files, focusing on the difference in average goals scored between women’s and men’s matches at a 10% significance level.

- **investigating_netflix_movies**\
    This project explores Netflix movies released in the 1990s using a provided dataset. It involves filtering movies from that decade, analyzing patterns like movie durations and genres, and visualizing the findings to understand trends in this nostalgic period of entertainment.


- **modeling_car_insurance_dc**\
    This project focuses on building a simple model to predict whether a car insurance customer will make a claim during their policy period. Identifies the single feature that leads to the best model accuracy to allow the insurance company to deploy an easy-to-manage solution. The project uses customer data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and trains models using each feature individually to evaluate their performance.

- **movie_rental_preds_dc**\
    This project aims to predict how many days a customer will rent a DVD using regression models. The goal is to create a model with a mean squared error (MSE) of 3 or less on a test set, helping the DVD rental company optimize inventory planning and improve efficiency.

- **pred_modeling_for_ag**\
    This project involves building multi-class classification models to predict the best crop type for a field based on soil measurements (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and pH). The goal is to identify which single soil feature most influences the accuracy of predicting the optimal crop type for maximizing yield.

- **taxi_optimization_rl_dc:**\
    Taxi route optimization project using reinforcement learning with gymnasium in Python. Utilizes Q-learning to develop and test a policy. 

- **visualizing_nobel_prize**\
    This project explores the Nobel Prize dataset from 1901 to 2023, analyzing trends and patterns of winners across categories such as chemistry, physics, medicine, literature, economics, and peace. It provides insights into demographics, gender representation, countries and institutions of laureates, and historical changes in the awards.
